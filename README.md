# Scorigami

Now available at the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/scorigami/%20id6443999951)!

Scorigami, a term originally coined by sportswriter Jon Bois, refers to the final score of an NFL game that has never occurred.
This iOS app lets you browse every score combination and see which are Scorigamis.

For those final scores that have occurred, you can see how many games ended in that score and when it last happened.
You can also see detailed information of every game score!

Thank you to pro-football-reference.com who provided all the historical data.

Scorigami is a work-in-progress app that was created in order to learn iOS app development with SwiftUI. Would love to get some feedback
